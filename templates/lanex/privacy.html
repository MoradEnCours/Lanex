                  Account password related information.
                  <br>1. The password complexity is required to be greater than eight digits, and the universal password 12345678 cannot be used.
                  <br>2. Make sure there is only a password. Do not use birthday, name, phone number, etc. as a password, but please remember to avoid forgetting the password.
                  <br>Firstly, creating the correct password will help ensure that you can log in to your account-and help others avoid access. 
                  <br>Secondly, donâ€™t use the password you use on other websites-if a website is hacked and your password is stolen, the hacker will usually try to use that password on other websites. 
                  <br>Finally, don't share your password with anyone. If you think someone else owns it, you should change it.
