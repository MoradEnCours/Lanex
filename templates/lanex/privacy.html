            1. The password complexity is required to be greater than eight digits, and the universal password
            12345678 cannot be used.
            <br>2. Make sure there is only a password. Do not use birthday, name, phone number, etc. as a password, but
            please remember to avoid forgetting the password.
            <br>Firstly, creating the correct password will help ensure that you can log in to your account-and help
            others avoid access.
            <br>Secondly, donâ€™t use the password you use on other websites-if a website is hacked and your password is
            stolen, the hacker will usually try to use that password on other websites.
            <br>Finally, don't share your password with anyone. If you think someone else owns it, you should change it.

        <p class="lead">About Cookies</p>
        <hr />

        <p class="lead">
            <br>A cookie is a file containing an identifier (a string of letters and numbers) that is sent by a web
            server to a web browser and is stored by the browser. The identifier is then sent back to the server each
            time the browser requests a page from the server.

            <br>Cookies may be either "persistent" cookies or "session" cookies: a persistent cookie will be stored by a
            web browser and will remain valid until its set expiry date, unless deleted by the user before the expiry
            date; a session cookie, on the other hand, will expire at the end of the user session, when the web browser
            is closed.

            <br>Cookies do not typically contain any information that personally identifies a user, but personal
            information that we store about you may be linked to the information stored in and obtained from cookies.
            <br>
